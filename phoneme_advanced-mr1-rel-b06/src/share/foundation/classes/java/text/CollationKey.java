/**
 * A <code>CollationKey</code> represents a <code>String</code> under the
 * rules of a specific <code>Collator</code> object. Comparing two
 * <code>CollationKey</code>s returns the relative order of the
 * <code>String</code>s they represent. Using <code>CollationKey</code>s
 * to compare <code>String</code>s is generally faster than using
 * <code>Collator.compare</code>. Thus, when the <code>String</code>s
 * must be compared multiple times, for example when sorting a list
 * of <code>String</code>s. It's more efficient to use <code>CollationKey</code>s.
 *
 * <p>
 * You can not create <code>CollationKey</code>s directly. Rather,
 * generate them by calling <code>Collator.getCollationKey</code>.
 * You can only compare <code>CollationKey</code>s generated from
 * the same <code>Collator</code> object.
 *
 * <p>
 * Generating a <code>CollationKey</code> for a <code>String</code>
 * involves examining the entire <code>String</code>
 * and converting it to series of bits that can be compared bitwise. This
 * allows fast comparisons once the keys are generated. The cost of generating
 * keys is recouped in faster comparisons when <code>String</code>s need
 * to be compared many times. On the other hand, the result of a comparison
 * is often determined by the first couple of characters of each <code>String</code>.
 * <code>Collator.compare</code> examines only as many characters as it needs which
 * allows it to be faster when doing single comparisons.
 * <p>
 * The following example shows how <code>CollationKey</code>s might be used
 * to sort a list of <code>String</code>s.
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * // Create an array of CollationKeys for the Strings to be sorted.
 * Collator myCollator = Collator.getInstance();
 * CollationKey[] keys = new CollationKey[3];
 * keys[0] = myCollator.getCollationKey("Tom");
 * keys[1] = myCollator.getCollationKey("Dick");
 * keys[2] = myCollator.getCollationKey("Harry");
 * sort( keys );
 * <br>
 * //...
 * <br>
 * // Inside body of sort routine, compare keys this way
 * if( keys[i].compareTo( keys[j] ) > 0 )
 *    // swap keys[i] and keys[j]
 * <br>
 * //...
 * <br>
 * // Finally, when we've returned from sort.
 * System.out.println( keys[0].getSourceString() );
 * System.out.println( keys[1].getSourceString() );
 * System.out.println( keys[2].getSourceString() );
 * </pre>

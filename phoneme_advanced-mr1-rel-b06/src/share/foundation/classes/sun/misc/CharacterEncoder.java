/**
 * This class defines the encoding half of character encoders.
 * A character encoder is an algorithim for transforming 8 bit binary
 * data into text (generally 7 bit ASCII or 8 bit ISO-Latin-1 text)
 * for transmition over text channels such as e-mail and network news.
 * 
 * The character encoders have been structured around a central theme
 * that, in general, the encoded text has the form:
 *
 * <pre>
 *	[Buffer Prefix]
 *	[Line Prefix][encoded data atoms][Line Suffix]
 *	[Buffer Suffix]
 * </pre>
 *
 * In the CharacterEncoder and CharacterDecoder classes, one complete
 * chunk of data is referred to as a <i>buffer</i>. Encoded buffers 
 * are all text, and decoded buffers (sometimes just referred to as 
 * buffers) are binary octets.
 *
 * To create a custom encoder, you must, at a minimum,  overide three
 * abstract methods in this class.
 * <DL>
 * <DD>bytesPerAtom which tells the encoder how many bytes to 
 * send to encodeAtom
 * <DD>encodeAtom which encodes the bytes sent to it as text.
 * <DD>bytesPerLine which tells the encoder the maximum number of
 * bytes per line.
 * </DL>
 *
 * Several useful encoders have already been written and are 
 * referenced in the See Also list below.

/**
 * The component-level focus event.
 * There are two levels of focus change events: permanent and temporary.
 * Permanent focus change events occur when focus is directly moved
 * from one component to another, such as through calls to requestFocus()
 * or as the user uses the Tab key to traverse components.
 * Temporary focus change events occur when focus is temporarily
 * gained or lost for a component as the indirect result of another
 * operation, such as window deactivation or a scrollbar drag.  In this
 * case, the original focus state will automatically be restored once
 * that operation is finished, or, for the case of window deactivation,
 * when the window is reactivated.  Both permanent and temporary focus
 * events are delivered using the FOCUS_GAINED and FOCUS_LOST event ids;
 * the levels may be distinguished in the event using the isTemporary()
 * method.

/**
 * For obtaining references to remote objects, RMI provides a simple
 * remote object registry interface, implemented by RMI's
 * <code>rmiregistry</code>, that provides methods for storing and retrieving
 * remote object references.  The <code>java.rmi.Naming</code> class
 * provides methods to access a remote object registry using URL-formatted
 * names to specify in a compact format both the remote registry along
 * with the name for the remote object.
 *
 * <p>Typically a "registry" exists on every node that allows RMI connections
 * to servers on that node.  A registry on a particular node contains a
 * transient database that maps names to remote objects.  When a registry
 * starts up, the registry database is empty.  The names stored in the
 * registry are pure and are not parsed.  A service storing itself in the
 * registry may want to prefix its name of the service by a package name
 * (although not required), to reduce name collisions in the registry.
 *
 * <p>To create a registry that runs in an application, use one of the
 * <code>LocateRegistry.createRegistry</code> methods.  To obtain a reference
 * to a remote object registry, use one of the
 * <code>LocateRegistry.getRegistry</code> methods.

 * Key for an object registry, held in a hashtable.  This is a weak key that
 * knows to clean up the hashtable it's in when it is collected.  It's

 * refers to for hashing purposes.  That means you can search for the
 * referred-to object in the hashtable, without wrapping it in a
 * RegistryKey instance.

 * object to which they refer are <i>identical</i>.  Two remote objects
 * that are != but are .equals() should <i>not</i> be treated as the same

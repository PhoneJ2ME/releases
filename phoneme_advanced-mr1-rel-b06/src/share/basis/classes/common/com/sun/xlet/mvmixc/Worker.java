/**
 * A Worker executes a Runnable in the background.  For efficiency, a
 * simple thread pool is maintained.  Threads are created when needed,
 * and a thread with no work to do for ten seconds is destroyed.
 * <p>
 * It would make sense to use this Worker class in the app manager,
 * e.g. for xlet lifecycle control, since sending those events is rare.
 * <p>
 * This class assumes that creation and destruction of java.lang.Thread
 * instances is relatively expensive.  Of course, java.lang.Thread might
 * do its own pooling of underlying native threads; if this is so,
 * then it may be somewhat more efficient to just create a new
 * java.lang.Thread for each call.

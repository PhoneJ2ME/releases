 * This interface allows an application manager to create,
 * initialize, start, pause, and destroy an Xlet.
 * An Xlet is an application or service designed to be run and
 * controlled by an application manager via this lifecycle interface.
 * The lifecycle states allow the application manager to manage
 * the activities of multiple Xlets within a runtime environment
 * selecting which Xlets are active at a given time.
 * The application manager maintains the state of the Xlet and
 * invokes method on the Xlet via the lifecycle methods.  The Xlet
 * implements these methods to update its internal activities and
 * resource usage as directed by the application manager. 
 * The Xlet can initiate some state changes itself and informs
 * the application manager of those state changes  
 * by invoking methods on <code>XletContext</code>.<p>
 *
 * In order to support interoperability between Xlets and application
 * managers, all Xlet classes must provide a public no-argument
 * constructor.<p>
 * 
 * <b>Note:</b> The methods on this interface are meant to signal state 
 * changes. The state change is not considered complete until the state
 * change method has returned. It is intended that these methods return
 * quickly.<p>

    /* A Reference instance is in one of four possible internal states:
     *
     *	   Active: Subject to special treatment by the garbage collector.  Some
     *	   time after the collector detects that the reachability of the
     *	   referent has changed to the appropriate state, it changes the
     *	   instance's state to either Pending or Inactive, depending upon
     *	   whether or not the instance was registered with a queue when it was
     *	   created.  In the former case it also adds the instance to the
     *	   pending-Reference list.  Newly-created instances are Active unless
     *	   their referents are null, in which case they are Inactive.
     *
     *	   Pending: An element of the pending-Reference list, waiting to be
     *	   enqueued by the Reference-handler thread.  Unregistered instances
     *	   are never in this state.
     *
     *	   Enqueued: An element of the queue with which the instance was
     *	   registered when it was created.  When an instance is removed from
     *	   its ReferenceQueue, it is made Inactive.  Unregistered instances are
     *	   never in this state.
     *
     *	   Inactive: Nothing more to do.  Once an instance becomes Inactive its
     *	   state will never change again.
     *
     * The state is encoded in the queue and next fields as follows:
     *
     *	   Active: queue = ReferenceQueue with which instance is registered, or
     *	   ReferenceQueue.NULL if it was not registered with a queue; next =
     *	   null.
     *
     *	   Pending: queue = ReferenceQueue with which instance is registered;
     *	   next = Following instance in queue, or this if at end of list.
     *
     *	   Enqueued: queue = ReferenceQueue.ENQUEUED; next = Following instance
     *	   in queue, or this if at end of list.
     *
     *	   Inactive: queue = ReferenceQueue.NULL; next = this.
     *
     * With this scheme the collector need only examine the next field in order
     * to determine whether a Reference instance requires special treatment: If
     * the next field is null then the instance is active; if it is non-null,
     * then the collector should treat the instance normally.

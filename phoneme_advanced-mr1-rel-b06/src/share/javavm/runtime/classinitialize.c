 * This version supports both CVMclassInit and CVMclassInitNoCRecursion.
 * If p_mb == 0, then is uses JNI to invoke Class.runStaticInitializers.
 *
 * If p_mb != 0 then it avoids C recursion by pushing a transition
 * frame that knows how to invoke Class.runStaticInitializers and then
 * munges the interpreter state so that upon return the interpeter 
 * starts executing at the beginning of Class.runStaticInitializers.
 *
 * We could have avoided the transition frame and just setup a JavaFrame
 * for Class.runStaticInitializers, but this would require some
 * extra logic in handle_return, which would slow down all method returns.
 *
 * Please note that in one case Class.runStaticInitializers is actually
 * invoked from here and in other caes the interpreter state is modified
 * so that upon return the interpreter will start executing 
 * Class.runStaticInitializers.
 * 
 * RESULT if p_mb != NULL:
 *   0 - No action taken. Class is already initialized.
 *   1 - Transition frame successfully pushed.
 *  -1 - An error occured. Exception was thrown.
 *

 *   0 - Initialization successful or class is already initialized

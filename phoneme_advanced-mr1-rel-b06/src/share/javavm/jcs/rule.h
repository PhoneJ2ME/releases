 * This is the internal representation of the rules

 * be referred in the pmatch program produced,
 * and in debugging output.
 *
 * There is also the head of a linked list of items
 * representing matches or partial matches to this
 * rule. I believe this is the fastest way to check for
 * the existence of an item (which are unique). See

 * "symbol" and its derivatives.
 * a symbol is the representation of any named
 * entity -- terminal or nonterminal -- in busbuild.
 * Symbols have the obvious attributs of name and type.
 * Symbols have lists of rules in which they appear as
 * the goal (nonterminals only, we trust), and in which
 * they appear in the rule body (either). Terminal
 * symbols have transition matricies, the dimensionality
 * of which depends on the symbol type. This is achieved
 * using derived classes, given at the end of this file.
 * Like most other things in busbild, symbols can be
 * made into lists, which can be iterated through.

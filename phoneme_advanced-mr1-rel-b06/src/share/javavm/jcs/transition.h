/*
 * @(#)transition.h	2.19	93/10/25
 * This file declares these classes
 *	generic_transition
 *	leaf_transition
 *	unary_transition
 *	binary_transition
 *
 * The definitions of state transition matrices.
 * In the most general (binary) case,
 * 	transition_table->state[left_child_state][right_child_state] 
 * gives the state number to be associated with the tree node.
 * We subset this in obvious ways for unary (one child) and
 * leaf i.e. nullary (no children) ops.
 *
 * children states are numbered starting at zero, of course,
 * and matricies are always square. All transition table entries
 * (even for the 0-dimensional ones) are initialized to the
 * distinguished value BAD_STATENO. Transition table entries should be
 * given values using the insert_stateno function defined
 * at the end of this file, which checks for the BAD_STATENO value. This
 * is in order to detect stray pointer addressing and re-evaluation
 * of transitions we thought were already evaluated.
 *
 * Transitions matricies are apparently only read by the print routine.
 *
 * Transition matricies are attached to symbol table entries.
 * The specific type of table is determined by looking
 * at the symbol's type, which also gives the symbol-table
 * variant to use.

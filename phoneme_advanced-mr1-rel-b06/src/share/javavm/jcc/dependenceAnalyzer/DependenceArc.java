 * A DependenceArc connects two DependenceNode structures.
 * The "from" node has a dependence on the "to" node.
 * The "type" of dependence is not defined by us here, but depends
 * on the type of analysis being done. See the DependenceAnalyzer
 * classes. An alternative design would be to use subclassing of
 * DependenceArc to indicate dependence type. Let me know.
 *
 * Generally, we will know either the "from" or the "to" from 
 * context (as we're traversing a dependsOn or dependedOn enumeration)
 * and will only need to look at the other.

/*
 * The CVMConstantPool is made up of two parallel arrays. One contains type
 * information for each constant pool entry (cpTypes), and the other
 * contains the constant pool entry itself (entries). A entry may already
 * be resolved, in which case cpTypes for the entry will have the
 * CVM_CP_ENTRY_RESOLVED bit set.
 *
 * Romized classes don't require a cpTypes array so cpTypes will be
 * NULL in this case, unless class loading also isn't supported, in which
 * case the cpTypes field doesn't even exist.
 *
 * A constant pool entry can be in one of three states:
 * 1. resolved - the entry is fully resolved. It is ready to be used
 *    as-is by the interpreter.
 * 2. unresolved - the entry needs to be resolved before it is used by
 *    the interpreter. Entries can be in this state after class loading
 *    is finished, but some entries (numbers and Strings) are considered to
 *    be fully resolved after class loading is finished.
 * 3. intermediate - An entry can be in this state after class loading has
 *    has created the intial constant pool (this is called the first pass).
 *    On the second pass, all intermediate entries will either become
 *    unresolved, resolved, or no longer needed. It is called the
 *    "intermediate" state because entries are only in this state for a short
 *    period during class loading. No code outside of the class loader
 *    should ever access an entry in the intermediate state.
 *
 * The chart below helps explain the transformation constant pool entries
 * will go through, starting with the form they take in the class file.
 * As you read a row from left to right, the first non-empty column after
 * the "Class File" column is the initial state a constant pool entry
 * will be in after the first pass of class loading. For example, Integer
 * entries immediately become Resolved, FieldRefs become Unresolved, and
 * String entries are in the Intermediate state, which means more processing
 * will be done on them during the 2nd pass of class loading.
 *
 * After looking up the state a constant pool entry will be in after the first
 * pass of class loading, you can look to the next unempty column to the right
 * to find out which form and state the entry will take next. The "state" of
 * the column will indicate when the entry changes form. For example, a Class
 * entry in the class file starts off in the Intermediate state as a Class
 * entry. During the 2nd pass of class loading is moves to the unresolved
 * state as a ClassTypeID. During constant pool resolution, it moves to the
 * Resolved state as a ClassBlock. String entries don't have an Unresolved
 * form. They start off in the Intermediate state as String entries and 
 * during the 2nd pass of class loading become either a resolved StringObject
 * or a resolved StringICell.
 *
 * Utf8 entries are not used after class loading so they are put in the
 * Intermediate state for this reason, even though the Resolved state
 * might be more appropriate.
 *
 * FieldTypeID and MethodTypeID entries are put in the unresolved state
 * even though the resolved state might be more appropriate. This is done
 * for two reasons. The first is to be consistent with the handling of
 * ClassTypeID entries. The 2nd is so that there are no resolved entry
 * types that are not directly referenced by the intepreter.
 *
 * INVARIANT: Intermediate entry types are only accessed by the class
 * loader.
 *
 * INVARIANT: Unresolved entry types are only written by the class loader
 * and are only read by the constant pool resolver or while holding the
 * CVMcpLock().
 *
 * INVARIANT: All resolved entry types are accessed directly by the 
 * interpreter and the interpreter does not directly access any non-resolved
 * entry types.

/*
 * Constant Pool access lock.
 *
 * Sometimes setting or getting a constant pool entry must be done
 * within a lock because often you need to verify an entry's type before
 * you can get its value, but it's possible that the type may change may
 * change between the check and the fetch of the entry. Fortunately this
 * isn't always a problem, so there are opportunities to limit locking.
 * The following 3 situations outline when locking is necessary:
 * 
 * (1) The Interpreter Loop: The interpreter loop never needs to acquire
 * the lock because it only deals with fully resolved entries. Their
 * types and values do not change.
 *
 * (2) Classloader: The classloader never needs to acquire the lock because
 * it is not possible for another thread to access a constant pool that
 * the classloader is creating or modifying.
 *
 * (3) Quickening and Constant Pool Resolution: This is where all the
 * difficult locking work is done. There are a number a race conditions
 * that can happen here. Here are some rules that are followed to avoid
 * them:
 *
 *    Constant pool entries are always be resolved before the quickened opcode
 *    is written out. This prevents the interpeter loop from seeing a quick
 *    opcode while the constant pool entry is still unresolved.
 *
 *    Writing an entry must always be done within the lock (except during
 *    class loading). Writing an entry involves 2 writes: one for the type
 *    and one for the value. This must always be done within a lock to make
 *    sure other threads don't think an entry is of a certain type, but end
 *    up getting an invalid value because the type changed.
 *
 *    If you first check an entry's type and then read it based on the
 *    discovered type, this must all be done within the lock, unless you
 *    are dealing with a fully resolved type. The reason for this is that
 *    if the entry is unresolved, its type and value may end up changing
 *    after you verified the type, but before you read the value.
 *
 * Contention for this lock is very low, so a global lock is appropriate.

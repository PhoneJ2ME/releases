/*
 * This part of the porting layer defines CVM primitive types.
 *
 *
 * CVMInt8, CVMInt16, CVMInt32, CVMInt64
 * CVMUint8, CVMUint16, CVMUint32
 *
 * Signed and unsigned integers of specified bit width.
 * CVMInt32 represents a 32-bit signed integer.
 *
 * The 64-bit types can have an arbitrary representation,
 * such as a struct, but the other types must have a
 * native representation that is supported by the compiler.
 *
 * CVMfloat32, CVMfloat64
 *
 * Single and double-precision IEEE floating point types.
 * These can have an arbitrary representation.
 *
 *
 * CVMSize
 *
 * Equivalent to ansi C size_t.
 *
 * ANSI header file locations
 *
 * CVM_HDR_ANSI_LIMITS_H   (ANSI <limits.h>)
 * CVM_HDR_ANSI_STDIO_H    (ANSI <stdio.h>)
 * CVM_HDR_ANSI_STDARG_H   (ANSI <stdarg.h>)

 * Advanced platform features
 *
 * These features are not required, therefore a default
 * implementation will be used if these macros are not
 * defined.
 *
 * CVM_ADV_SCHEDLOCK
 *
 * Defined if the a scheduler lock (CVMschedLock) is supported.
 *
 * CVM_ADV_MUTEX_SET_OWNER
 *
 * Defined if setting the owner of a mutex (CVMmutexSetOwner)
 * is supported.
 *
 * CVM_ADV_ATOMIC_CMPANDSWAP
 *
 * Defined if atomic compare-and-swap (CVMatomicCompareAndSwap)
 * is supported.
 *
 * CVM_ADV_ATOMIC_SWAP
 *
 * Defined if atomic swap (CVMatomicSwap) is supported.
 *
 *
 * Process model
 *
 *   CVM_HAVE_PROCESS_MODEL
 *
 *   Defining this macro specifies that the platform (porting layer)
 *   implements a "process" model.  The VM will not attempt to wait
 *   for daemon threads before shutting down, nor will it attempt to
 *   free up resources.
 *
 *   If this macro is undefined, the VM will wait for all VM threads
 *   to exit before shutting down, and will try to release any
 *   resources that were allocated.

/* Standard segment size is the following. Assertions make sure that
   all the segment overhead for this size does not make the total
   allocation more than SEGMENT_SIZE */

/* NOTE: CARD_TABLE_BYTES_FOR_SEGMENT_ALIGNMENT is a magic number that is
   pre-calculated based on the SEGMENT_ALIGNMENT value specified.  This
   value is basically computed as:
     cardCount + (sizeof(CVMGenSummaryTableEntry) * cardCount) + cardCount
   where
     usableSpace = SEGMENT_ALIGNMENT - CARD_TABLE_BYTES_FOR_SEGMENT_ALIGNMENT;
     cardCount0 = (usableSpace + NUM_BYTES_PER_CARD - 1) / NUM_BYTES_PER_CARD;
     cardCount = round(cardCount0, sizeof(CVMUint32));

   The resultant number is attained by iterating between values of usableSpace
   and CARD_TABLE_BYTES_FOR_SEGMENT_ALIGNMENT.

   For a SEGMENT_ALIGNMENT of 64k, cardCount turns out to be 128 and
   CARD_TABLE_BYTES_FOR_SEGMENT_ALIGNMENT turns out to be 764 bytes.

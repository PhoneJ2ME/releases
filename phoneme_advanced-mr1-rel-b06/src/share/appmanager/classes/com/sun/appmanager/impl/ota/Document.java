 * A Document wrapper to hold parsed XML output. In

 * including the outermost element which is the document
 * itself. This is to make it easier while doing the parsing.
 * This outer class exists mainly to provide a fairly easy
 * way for someone to iterate through the elements (or nodes)
 * in the parsed document.

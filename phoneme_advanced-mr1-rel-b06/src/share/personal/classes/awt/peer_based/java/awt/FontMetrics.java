/**
 * A font metrics object, which gives information about the rendering
 * of a particular font on a particular screen. Note that the
 * implementations of these methods are inefficient, they are usually
 * overridden with more efficient toolkit-specific implementations.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note to subclassers</b>: Since many of these methods form closed
 * mutually recursive loops, you must take care that you implement
 * at least one of the methods in each such loop in order to prevent
 * infinite recursion when your subclass is used.
 * In particular, the following is the minimal suggested set of methods
 * to override in order to ensure correctness and prevent infinite
 * recursion (though other subsets are equally feasible):
 * <ul>
 * <li><a href=#getAscent>getAscent</a>()
 * <li><a href=#getDescent>getDescent</a>()
 * <li><a href=#getLeading>getLeading</a>()
 * <li><a href=#getMaxAdvance>getMaxAdvance</a>()
 * <li><a href="#charWidth(char)">charWidth</a>(char ch)
 * <li><a href="#charsWidth(char[], int, int)">charsWidth</a>(char data[], int off, int len)
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <img src="images-awt/FontMetrics-1.gif" border=15 align
 * ALIGN=right HSPACE=10 VSPACE=7>
 * When an application asks AWT to place a character at the position
 * (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>), the character is placed so that its
 * reference point (shown as the dot in the accompanying image) is
 * put at that position. The reference point specifies a horizontal
 * line called the <i>baseline</i> of the character. In normal
 * printing, the baselines of characters should align.
 * <p>
 * In addition, every character in a font has an <i>ascent</i>, a
 * <i>descent</i>, and an <i>advance width</i>. The ascent is the
 * amount by which the character ascends above the baseline. The
 * descent is the amount by which the character descends below the
 * baseline. The advance width indicates the position at which AWT
 * should place the next character.
 * <p>
 * If the current character is placed with its reference point
 * at the position (<i>x</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>), and
 * the character's advance width is <i>w</i>, then the following
 * character is placed with its reference point at the position
 * (<i>x&nbsp;</i><code>+</code><i>&nbsp;w</i>,&nbsp;<i>y</i>).
 * The advance width is often the same as the width of character's
 * bounding box, but need not be so. In particular, oblique and
 * italic fonts often have characters whose top-right corner extends
 * slightly beyond the advance width.
 * <p>
 * An array of characters or a string can also have an ascent, a
 * descent, and an advance width. The ascent of the array is the
 * maximum ascent of any character in the array. The descent is the
 * maximum descent of any character in the array. The advance width
 * is the sum of the advance widths of each of the characters in the
 * array.

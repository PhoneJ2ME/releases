/**
 * A generic container used for embedding Java components, usually applets.  
 * An EmbeddedFrame has two related uses:  
 * 
 * . Within a Java-based application, an EmbeddedFrame serves as a sort of
 *   firewall, preventing the contained components or applets from using
 *   getParent() to find parent components, such as menubars.
 *
 * . Within a C-based application, an EmbeddedFrame contains a window handle
 *   which was created by the application, which serves as the top-level
 *   Java window.  EmbeddedFrames created for this purpose are passed-in a
 *   handle of an existing window created by the application.  The window
 *   handle should be of the appropriate native type for a specific 
 *   platform, as stored in the pData field of the ComponentPeer.

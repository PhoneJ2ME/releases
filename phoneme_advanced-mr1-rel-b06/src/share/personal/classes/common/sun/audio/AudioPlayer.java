/**
 * This class provides an interface to play audio streams.
 *
 * To play an audio stream use:
 * <pre>
 *	AudioPlayer.player.start(audiostream);
 * </pre>
 * To stop playing an audio stream use:
 * <pre>
 *	AudioPlayer.player.stop(audiostream);
 * </pre>
 * To play an audio stream from a URL use:
 * <pre>
 *	AudioStream audiostream = new AudioStream(url.openStream());
 *	AudioPlayer.player.start(audiostream);
 * </pre>
 * To play a continuous sound you first have to
 * create an AudioData instance and use it to construct a
 * ContinuousAudioDataStream.
 * For example:
 * <pre>
 *	AudoData data = new AudioStream(url.openStream()).getData();
 *	ContinuousAudioDataStream audiostream = new ContinuousAudioDataStream(data);
 *	AudioPlayer.player.stop(audiostream);
 * </pre>

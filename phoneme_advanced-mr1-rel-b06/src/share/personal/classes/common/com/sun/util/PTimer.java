 * A class representing a timer.
 *
 * A timer is responsible for managing a set of timer events specified
 * by timer specifications.  When the timer event should be sent,
 * the timer calls the timer specification's notifyListeners method.
 * <h3>Compatibility</h3>
 * The PTimer class is available on PersonalJava implementations,
 * but is not available on J2SE platforms. It is optional on Personal
 * Profile implementations, but has been deprecated. The <code>java.util.timer</code>
 * class should be used instead, except in cases where PersonalJava
 * compatibility is necessary.
 *
 * @since PersonalJava1.0
 * @deprecated This class is kept for backwards compatiability with Personal Java.
 The java.util.Timer class is the preferred way of implementing
 timers under the Personal Profile.

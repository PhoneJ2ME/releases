 * CCM functions: called directly by compiled code,
 * supplied by the platform.
 * Routines with 'Glue' names often save state and
 * marshal parameters as required, then
 * call C routines to do the work, though sometimes they
 * can do some of the work themselves in the simpler cases.
 * It depends on how much effort you want to make retargeting.
 *
 * Parameters are passed in the CVMCPU_ARGn_REG registers as defined
 * in jitrisc.h
 *
 * In some cases, for the convenience of the glue functions,
 * the compiled code does not pass parameters starting in
 * the usual position, but further down the list. This allows
 * a glue function to easily fill in the missing pieces
 * (such as a CVMExecEnv* parameter )
 * and call into the VM service
 * without having to copy things around. PAY ATTENTION!
 * I will use "void" parameters to indicated the gaps.

 * a) #ifdef CVMCPU_HAS_ALU_SETCC, then the move instruction used will set 
 *    the CC and the helper glue can use the CC to determine immediately 
 *    whether objPtr is null.
 * b) The inline guess cell allows the the glue code to make a quick
 *    test before calling into the system. It  keeps the actual 
 *    classBlock* of the last successful call
 *    from this location.
 * The Glue routines must test the objPtr for null and its classblock
 * for equality with the targetClassBlock before calling the rest of the
 * system.
 * The Glue routines will call one of CVMCCMruntimeInstanceOf or
 * CVMCCMruntimeCheckCast if the quick tests (for null and for 
 * classblock equality with targetClassBlock or the guess)
 * don't yield definitive results.
 * Those routines take the address of the guessCB cell as a parameter,

 * The following all call different underlying systems functions,

 *
 *      load          Rx,cachedConstant ! use PC-relative address if possible
 * patchHere:
 *	load-constant CVMCPU_ARG3_REG,cpIndex

 * resolveReturn2:
 *
 * The Glue code needs to call CVMCCMruntimeResolve<entryType><AndClinit>,
 * after having adjusted the return address
 * to return to resolveReturn1.
 * It will also form the address of cachedConstant and pass it to
 * the system to be filled in. 
 *
 * As in the case with CVMCCMruntimeRunClassInitializer, the system
 * will behave in one of a number of ways:
 * -- if the class gets initialized in this thread, then
 *    the system returns directly to the calling compiled code. This 
 *    is because of the way we avoid C recursion at this point by making
 *    it into Java stack recursion. In order to do this, make sure to
 *    update the return PC before flushing it to the Java stack frame,
 *    so that execution of the compiled code is resumed at resolveReturn1.
 * -- if the class was already initialized, then
 *    the system code will return TRUE to the Glue code.
 *    The Glue code can rewrite the instruction at 'patchHere'
 *    (but not the instruction before it, which may be at the beginning
 *    of a block and thus liable for rewriting for a GC rendezvous)
 *    into a branch to 'resolveReturn2.' (It also works to patch the
 *    call if that's easier because of needing to atomically provide
 *    a branch and its delay slot.)
 * -- if the class is being initialized by the current thread (and yes,
 *    recursion does happen in initialization), then
 *    CVMCCMruntimeRunClassInitializer will return TRUE to the Glue code.
 *    In this case the Glue code should return to 'resolveReturn1' 
 *    without rewriting.
 * -- an exception occurs and the stack is unwound using the usual exception
 *    delivery mechanism.
 * In the non-exceptional cases, the cache word is filled in with 
 * the required value.

#
# Common properties -- These properties are used for all protocols
#
# The datagram host is the name of the client or /target device. Messages are
# sent to and/or received from this client. The host can be an alias that maps
# in /etc/hosts (UNIX/Linux systems) to a a real client device name. The alias
# can also be mapped to the IP address of the device under test.
#
DatagramHost=wmadatagramhost
#
# The phone number starts with "+" and is followed by a number of digits
# (e.g.: +5551234). The phone number represents the number of a device that
# would contact the MIDP code under test. The phone number is the same across
# all protocols.
#
PhoneNumber=+5551234

#
# SMS properties -- These properties are used by SMSMessageConnector.
#
# The "out" port is used for sending messages. The "in" port is used for
# receiving messages and acknowledgements. The ports represent physical
# transport-layer port numbers and may not match a port number in an SMS
# address.
#
SMSDatagramPortOut=11100
SMSDatagramPortIn=11101

#
# CBS properties -- These properties are used by CBSMessageConnector.
#
# The "out" port is used for broadcasting CBS messages. The CBS client can only
# receive the messages sent by the host. The port represents a physical
# transport-layer port number and may not match a port number of a CBS address.
#
CBSDatagramPortOut=22200

#
# MMS properties -- These properties are used by MMSMessageConnector.
#
# The port numbers represent the server-side datagram ports. These values
# will be opposite to the "in" and "out" ports in the XML properties file
# of the client (MIDP) code.
#
# The "reply-to" application ID is not real, but simply representative of
# a real-world application ID string. Normally, this would be the path to
# the application that would process the message data sent to the server
# (or, in this case, to the tool code.).
#
MMSDatagramPortOut=33300
MMSDatagramPortIn=33301
MMSReplyToAppID=com.sun.mms.MMSTest

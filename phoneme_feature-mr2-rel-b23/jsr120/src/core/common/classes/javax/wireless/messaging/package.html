    <title>Wireless Messaging API</title>
    <!-- Changed  18-Mar-2002 -->
  </head>

  <body>
    <p> This package defines an API which
        allows applications to send and receive wireless
        messages. The API is generic and independent of the
        underlying messaging protocol. The underlying protocol
        can be, for example, GSM Short Message Service, CDMA SMS, and so on.
    </p>



    <H2>Overview</H2>
    <p>This package is designed to work with <code>Message</code> objects that may
    contain different elements depending on the underlying
    messaging protocol. This is different from <code>Datagrams</code> that are
    assumed always to be blocks of binary data.
    </p>
    <p>
    An adapter specification for a given messaging protocol may define
    further interfaces derived from the <code>Message</code> interfaces included in
    this generic specification.
    </p>
    <p>
    Unlike network layer
    datagrams, the wireless messaging protocols that are accessed by using
    this API are typically of store-and-forward nature. Messages will usually
    reach the recipient,
    even if the recipient is not connected at the time of sending. This may
    happen significantly later if the
    recipient is disconnected for a long period of time. Sending and possibly
    also receiving these wireless messages typically involves a
    financial cost to the end user that cannot be neglected. Therefore,
    applications should not send unnecessary messages.
    </p>

    <H2>The MessageConnection and Message Interfaces</H2>

    <p>
    The <code>MessageConnection</code> interface represents a
    <code>Connection</code> that can be used for sending and receiving
    messages. The application opens a <code>MessageConnection</code>
    with the Generic Connection Framework by providing a URL
    connection string.
    </p>
    <p>The <code>MessageConnection</code> can be opened either in
    "server" or in "client" mode. A "server" mode connection is
    opened by providing a URL that specifies an identifier for
    an application on the local device for incoming messages. A port number
    is an example of an identifier.
    Messages received with this identifier will then be
    delivered to the application by using this connection.
    A "server" mode connection can be used both for sending and
    for receiving messages.
    </p>
    <p>
    A "client" mode connection
    is opened by providing a URL that points to another device. A "client"
    mode connection can only be used for sending messages.
    </p>
    <p>The messages are represented by the <code>Message</code> interface
    and interfaces derived from it. The <code>Message</code> interface
    has the very basic functions that are common to all messages.
    Derived interfaces represent messages of different types and provide
    methods for accessing type-specific features. The kinds of derived
    interfaces that are supported depends on the
    underlying messaging protocol.  If necessary, interfaces derived
    from <code>Message</code> can be defined in the adapter definitions
    for mapping the API to an underlying protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
    The mechanism to derive new interfaces from the
    <code>Message</code> is intended
    as an extensibility mechanism allowing new protocols to be supported
    in platforms. Applications are not expected to create their own
    classes that implement the
    <code>Message</code> interface. The only correct way for
    applications to create object instances implementing the
    <code>Message</code>
    interface is to use the <code>MessageConnection.newMessage</code>
    factory method.
    </p>
    <p>
    <code>BinaryMessage</code> and <code>TextMessage</code> are 
    subinterfaces of <code>Message</code>
    representing binary and text messages. They have methods to get and set the
    binary/text data payloads. To create instances of these classes, use the
    <code>MessageConnection.newMessage</code> factory method, using
    <code>MessageConnection.BINARY_MESSAGE</code> or 
    <code>MessageConnection.TEXT_MESSAGE</code> for the message type.
    </p>
    <p>
    The <code>MessageListener</code> interface provides a mechanism for 
    the application to be notified of incoming messages. The listener 
    mechanism allows applications to receive incoming messages without 
    needing to have a thread blocked in the <code>receive()</code> method call.

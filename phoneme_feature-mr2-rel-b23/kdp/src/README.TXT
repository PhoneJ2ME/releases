KDWP DEBUG PROXY (DEBUG AGENT) TOOL

The directory contains the source code of the
KDWP Debug Proxy (also known as Debug Agent)
implementation.

Debug Proxy is a tool that can be interposed between
a Java development environment (such as Forte) and 
the KDWP-enabled Java VM. The Debug Proxy allows many 
of the memory-consuming components of a JPDA (Java 
Platform Debug Architecture) compliant debugger to be 
processed on the development workstation, thereby 
reducing the memory overhead that the debugging 
interfaces have on the Java VM and its target devices.

For further information on the Debug Proxy, refer
to the KWDP Specification.

	   If instead of PAGE_READONLY, we use PAGE_NOACCESS together with
	   MEM_RESERVE and we request a size greater than 2M, than the address
	   range will be reserved from shared memory.  Note that shared memory
	   can be read and written to by other processes as long as they know
	   the address.  This could open the heap data to security
	   vulnerabilities, and expose the VM to attacks more easily.

	   Note that PAGE_READONLY doesn't actually mean that the page is
	   read only later, nor does PAGE_NOACCESS means that the page is
	   in accessible.  Before the pages are used, they will be committed
	   in CVMmemCommit() using VirtualAlloc(... PAGE_READWRITE).  Hence,
	   we'll have read write access to the committed heap pages.

/* NOTE: CVMvolatileStore() could conceptually be implemented using a
   a normal assignment statement.  It is implemented using a call to
   CVMatomicSwap() instead to enforce the 'volatile' status of the
   lockWord.  Calling a function to set it ensures that it is done at
   the location that the programmer intended and not shuffled around
   by the compiler.

   NOTE: Making this inline assembler that just does a store like the
   ARM port does would help performance.

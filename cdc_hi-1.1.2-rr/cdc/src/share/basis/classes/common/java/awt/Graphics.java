/**
 * The <code>Graphics</code> class is the abstract base class for 
 * all graphics contexts that allow an application to draw onto 
 * components that are realized on various devices, as well as 
 * onto off-screen images.
 * <p>
 * A <code>Graphics</code> object encapsulates state information needed
 * for the basic rendering operations that Java supports.  This
 * state information includes the following properties:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>The <code>Component</code> object on which to draw.
 * <li>A translation origin for rendering and clipping coordinates.
 * <li>The current clip.
 * <li>The current color.
 * <li>The current font.
 * <li>The current logical pixel operation function (XOR or Paint).
 * <li>The current XOR alternation color 
 *     (see <a href="#setXORMode"><code>setXORMode</code></a>).
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Coordinates are infinitely thin and lie between the pixels of the
 * output device.
 * Operations which draw the outline of a figure operate by traversing
 * an infinitely thin path between pixels with a pixel-sized pen that hangs
 * down and to the right of the anchor point on the path.
 * Operations which fill a figure operate by filling the interior
 * of that infinitely thin path.
 * Operations which render horizontal text render the ascending
 * portion of character glyphs entirely above the baseline coordinate.
 * <p>
 * The graphics pen hangs down and to the right from the path it traverses. 
 * This has the following implications:
 * <p><ul>
 * <li>If you draw a figure that covers a given rectangle, that 
 * figure occupies one extra row of pixels on the right and bottom edges 
 * as compared to filling a figure that is bounded by that same rectangle.
 * <li>If you draw a horizontal line along the same <i>y</i> coordinate as
 * the baseline of a line of text, that line is drawn entirely below
 * the text, except for any descenders.
 * </ul><p>
 * All coordinates which appear as arguments to the methods of this
 * <code>Graphics</code> object are considered relative to the 
 * translation origin of this <code>Graphics</code> object prior to 
 * the invocation of the method.
 * All rendering operations modify only pixels which lie within the
 * area bounded by both the current clip of the graphics context
 * and the extents of the component used to create the 
 * <code>Graphics</code> object.
 * All drawing or writing is done in the current color, 
 * using the current paint mode, and in the current font. 
 * <h3>Compatibility</h3>
 * The Graphics class is compatible with the graphics class in
 * PersonalJava. It has modified behavior from JDK1.1.8, in that
 * its setXorMode may not have any effect.

/**
 * The listener interface for receiving mouse wheel events on a component.
 * (For clicks and other mouse events, use the MouseListener.  For mouse 
 * movement and drags, use the MouseMotionListener.)
 * <P>
 * The class that is interested in processing a mouse wheel event
 * implements this interface (and all the methods it contains).
 * <P>
 * The listener object created from that class is then registered with a
 * component using the component's <code>addMouseWheelListener</code> 
 * method. A mouse wheel event is generated when the mouse wheel is rotated.
 * When a mouse wheel event occurs, that object's <code>mouseWheelMoved</code>
 * method is invoked.

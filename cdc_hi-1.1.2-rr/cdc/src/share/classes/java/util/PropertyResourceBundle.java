/**
 * <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code> is a concrete subclass of
 * <code>ResourceBundle</code> that manages resources for a locale
 * using a set of static strings from a property file. See
 * {@link ResourceBundle ResourceBundle} for more information about resource
 * bundles. See {@link Properties Properties} for more information
 * about properties files, in particular the
 * <a href="Properties.html#encoding">information on character encodings</a>.
 *
 * <p>
 * Unlike other types of resource bundle, you don't subclass
 * <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code>.  Instead, you supply properties
 * files containing the resource data.  <code>ResourceBundle.getBundle</code>
 * will automatically look for the appropriate properties file and create a
 * <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code> that refers to it. See
 * {@link ResourceBundle#getBundle(java.lang.String, java.util.Locale, java.lang.ClassLoader) ResourceBundle.getBundle}
 * for a complete description of the search and instantiation strategy.
 *
 * <p>
 * The following <a name="sample">example</a> shows a member of a resource
 * bundle family with the base name "MyResources".
 * The text defines the bundle "MyResources_de",
 * the German member of the bundle family.
 * This member is based on <code>PropertyResourceBundle</code>, and the text
 * therefore is the content of the file "MyResources_de.properties"
 * (a related <a href="ListResourceBundle.html#sample">example</a> shows
 * how you can add bundles to this family that are implemented as subclasses
 * of <code>ListResourceBundle</code>).
 * The keys in this example are of the form "s1" etc. The actual
 * keys are entirely up to your choice, so long as they are the same as
 * the keys you use in your program to retrieve the objects from the bundle.
 * Keys are case-sensitive.
 * <blockquote>
 * <pre>
 * # MessageFormat pattern
 * s1=Die Platte \"{1}\" enth&auml;lt {0}.
 *
 * # location of {0} in pattern
 * s2=1
 *
 * # sample disk name
 * s3=Meine Platte
 *
 * # first ChoiceFormat choice
 * s4=keine Dateien
 *
 * # second ChoiceFormat choice
 * s5=eine Datei
 *
 * # third ChoiceFormat choice
 * s6={0,number} Dateien
 *
 * # sample date
 * s7=3. M&auml;rz 1996
 * </pre>

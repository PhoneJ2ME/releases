Provides classes and interfaces for handling text, dates, numbers, and messages
in a manner independent of natural languages.  This means your main application
or applet can be written to be language-independent, and it can rely upon
separate, dynamically-linked localized resources. This allows the flexibility
of adding localizations for new localizations at any time.
<p>
These classes are capable of formatting dates, numbers, and messages, parsing;
searching and sorting strings; and iterating over characters, words, sentences,
and line breaks.  This package contains three main groups of classes and
interfaces:
<ul>
<li>Classes for iteration over text
<li>Classes for formatting and parsing
<li>Classes for string collation
</ul>

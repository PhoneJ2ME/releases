 * Dynamic linking support.
 *
 * These routines look very similar to the dynamic linking facilities
 * on Solaris and Win32. However, on VxWorks there is currently no
 * notion of a local symbol table (submitted as an RFE; TSR# 143425.)
 * Therefore symbol lookup is slow on VxWorks as we have to iterate
 * through the entire system symbol table every time. It is required
 * by the Java libraries that sit above these routines that a notion
 * of local symbol namespaces be maintained.
 *
 * On VxWorks these routines require three libraries to be built into
 * your project if they are not already: loadLib, moduleLib, and
 * symLib.

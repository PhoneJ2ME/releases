 * GC CheckPoints support.
 *
 * There are three choice for handling gc rendezvous points (checkpoints)
 * in compiled code:
 *   1. Patch-based gc checks, enabled by doing a #define of
 *      CVMJIT_PATCH_BASED_GC_CHECKS. When a gc is requested, each
 *      gc checkpoint is patched with an instruction that will make
 *      sure CVMD_gcRendezvous() is called. This technique gives zero
 *      overhead gc points, but is the hardest to implement.
 *   2. Trap-based gc checks, enabled by doing a #define of
 *      CVMJIT_TRAP_BASED_GC_CHECKS. At each gc point an instruction is
 *      generated that can conditionally produced a SEGV, but only when
 *      checkpoints are enabled. A signal handler will be responsible for
 *      making sure CVMD_gcRendezvous() is called. Not quite zero overhead
 *      like (1), but far better than (3) and easier to implement then (1).
 *   3. If neither CVMJIT_TRAP_BASED_GC_CHECKS or CVMJIT_TRAP_BASED_GC_CHECKS
 *      are enabled, then code is generated inline to check if a
 *      gc rendezvous has been requested, and call CVMD_gcRendezvous() if
 *      one has. This is the easiest of the 3 to implement, but has very
 *      high overhead, as much as 20% on some microbenchmarks.

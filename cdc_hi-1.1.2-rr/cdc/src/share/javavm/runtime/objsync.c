/* NOTES: About CVM object monitors and their life-cycles
   ======================================================

   The Fast Locking mechanism:
   ==========================
   CVM implements a fast locking mechanism which attempts to speed up monitor
   locking/unlocking operations for the monitors which meet the following
   criteria:
     1. The object monitor is locked and unlocked only by one thread at a time
        (i.e. no thread contention occurs while trying to lock or unlock the
        monitor).
     2. The object monitor isn't used for the Object.wait(), Object.notify(),
        Object.notifyAll().

   If the above criteria is met, then the lock is implemented by simply
   setting the low 2 bits of a header bit flag word in each object using some
   form of atomic operation.  The fast lock mechanism basically provides some
   speed optimization benefits due to:
     1. Not having to actually invoke OS system calls to allocate and
        lock/unlock a monitor.
     2. Reduce the amount of memory/resource allocations necessary to implement
        the monitor.  Monitors are allocated per thread as well as globally and
        are reclaimed for reuse through various scavenging mechanism.  This
        reuse speeds up monitor operations if a previously reclaimed monitor is
        available for reuse.

   At any time that the criteria for fast locking/unlocking are not met, the
   monitor implementation will inflate itself into a heavy weight monitor which
   relies on the platform-specific mutex and condvar implementations defined by
   the porting layer to do its locking/unlocking.

   Data Structures & Ownership of the data structures:
   ==================================================

   CVM object monitors are implemented using 2 data structures:
     1. The CVMOwnedMonitor record.
     2. The CVMObjMonitor monitor implementation.

     The CVMOwnedMonitor record is used to track locking information with or
     without an actual monitor.  CVMOwnedMonitors are allocated, freed, and
     modified exclusively by its owner thread.  This avoids contention between
     threads over the manipulation of CVMOwnedMonitors.

     The CVMObjMonitor is the actual monitor that is attached to the object
     when a heavy-weight lock needs to employed.  CVMObjMonitors, unlike
     CVMOwnedMonitors, are shared between threads and held in the global list.
     Contention is minimized by having each thread cache one instance of the
     CVMObjMonitor for its own use during the inflation process.  Otherwise,
     CVMObjMonitors in the global lists are protected from contention between
     threads by the CVMglobals.syncLock.

   In CVMglobals, there are:
     1. CVMglobals.objLocksBound: This is the list of bound monitors i.e.
            CVMObjMonitors which are attached to an object.
     2. CVMglobals.objLocksUnbound: This is the list of unbound monitors i.e.
            CVMObjMonitors which used to be attached to objects which have now
            been GC'ed.  This means that the monitor's object pointer is NULL.
     3. CVMglobals.objLocksFree: This is the list of free monitors i.e
            CVMObjMonitors which are not attached to any objects yet.

     4. CVMglobals.syncLock: This is the global lock used for protecting the
            above 3 monitor lists and for synchronizing threads which wish to:
            inflate a monitor, set an object hash code, or do an unlock
            operation on a fast lock.

   Each thread's CVMExecEnv has:
     1. ee->objLockCurrent: This is a per-thread reference to a CVMObjMonitor
            that is in the midst of being processed and has not yet been
            attached to an object yet.  This is necessary to prevent the
            referenced CVMObjMonitor from being scavenged prematurely.
     2. ee->objLocksFreeUnlocked: This is supply of CVMObjMonitors for use by
            the the thread in the event that it needs to do a monitor
            inflation.  The inflation process will replenish
            ee->objLocksFreeUnlocked at the end of the inflation process.
            The current implementation only keeps one CVMObjMonitor available
            in ee->objLocksFreeUnlocked.
     3. ee->objLocksOwned: This is a list of all the CVMOwnedMonitors which are
            locked by the thread.  These CVMOwnedMonitors may or may not be
            attached to an actual CVMObjMonitor.
     4. ee->objLocksFreeOwned: This is a list of free CVMOwnedMonitors
            available for the thread's use.

        Write access to these fields of the CVMExecEnv is exclusively owned by
        owner thread.  This avoids any contention between threads, and, hence,
        no synchronization mechanism is needed to synchronize accesses to these
        fields.

   The Monitor Life-Cycles & Processes:
   ===================================

    Inflation:
        . This is the process by which an object gets attached to a
          CVMObjMonitor.  This process is protected by the CVMglobals.syncLock.

    Initial state:
        . The object header bits indicate CVM_LOCKSTATE_UNLOCKED.

    Locked without contention (fast lock):
        . The object header bits indicate CVM_LOCKSTATE_LOCKED and holds a
          pointer to a CVMOwnedMonitor instance.
        . The thread who owns the lock on that object also holds a pointer to
          the same CVMOwnedMonitor in its owned list.
        . If the object header bits already indicate CVM_LOCKSTATE_LOCKED upon
          attempting to lock the monitor, then the CVMOwnedMonitor's reentry
          count is incremented.

    Locked with contention (heavy weight lock):
        . The object header bits indicate CVM_LOCKSTATE_MONITOR and holds a
          pointer to a CVMObjMonitor instance.
        . The CVMObjMonitor is marked as CVM_OBJMON_OWNED and put on the
          global bound list.
        . The thread who owns the lock still have a pointer to the
          CVMOwnedMonitor record.  The CVMOwnedMonitor record has a pointer to
          the CVMObjMonitor for the lock.

    Unlocked while holding a fast lock:
        . The CVMOwnedMonitor's reentry count is decremented.  If this count
          has not reached 0 yet, then the unlock operation is done.  Otherwise,
          the following steps are executed as well.
        . The object header bits are changed back to CVM_LOCKSTATE_UNLOCKED.
        . The CVMOwnedMonitor is moved from the owner thread's ee's owned list
          to its free list.

    Unlocked while holding a heavy weight lock:
        . The object header bits remains CVM_LOCKSTATE_MONITOR and the object
          retains its pointer to the CVMObjMonitor instance.
        . The CVMObjMonitor is marked as CVM_OBJMON_BOUND and remains on the
          global bound list.

    Each thread always keep one free CVMObjMonitor around to accelerate
    impending monitor inflation operations.  After a monitor has been inflated,
    the thread will attempt to replenish its spare free CVMObjMonitor.  It does
    this by either:
        1. Getting one from the global free list.
        2. Scavenging for bound monitors which are not locked.
        3. Allocating new ones.

    During CVMObjMonitor scavenging:
        . CVMObjMonitors which are bound (on the global bound list) but not
          locked are released into the global free list.
        . CVMObjMonitors which are on the global unbound list (see notes on
          monitor GC below) are unlocked and released into the global free
          list.

    CVMOwnedMonitor scavenging:
        . CVMOwnedMonitor needed by most monitor operations and attained before
          the operation commences (at the top of the functions).
        . Usually, it is attained from the thread's free list.  If the free
          list is empty, then the thread will attempt to replenish the free
          CVMOwnedMonitor supply by one of the following ways:
            1. Allocate a new one.
            2. Run the scavenger which searches the thread's owned list for
               monitors which have fast locks but are no longer associated
               with a live object (see notes on monitor GC below).  These
               monitor records are unlocked and released back into the thread's
               free list.  Since this case does not naturally happen with Java
               code, it is unlikely to occur.  Hence a scavenging operation is
               unlikely to yield a free CVMOwnedMonitor.  This is why we opt to
               allocate a new one first before attempting a scavenging
               operation.

    During a monitor GC (invoked by the GC):
        . CVMObjMonitors which are locked but no longer associated with a live
          object (because the object has been GC'ed but the lock hasn't been
          released prior) are moved from the global bound list to the global
          unbound list.  See notes on monitor scavenging above to see how these
          monitors get released back into the free lists for reuse.

          The CVMObjMonitors do not get moved directly from the bound list to
          the free list because bound CVMObjMonitors are attached to
          CVMOwnedMonitors.  Hence, the best that the GC thread can do is to
          tag the monitor by putting it on the unbound list and relying on the
          owner thread to release the attached CVMOwnedMonitor as well as put
          the CVMObjMonitor back on the free list.

    During thread destruction:
        . When a thread shuts down, it will unlock all monitors whose lock it
          owns if those monitors are still associated with live objects.
        . While attempting to unlock monitors, if the thread encounters any
          monitors which are no longer associated with any live objects, it
          will invoke the appropriate scavengers to reclaim the monitors into
          the free lists.
        . After reclaiming or unlocking all the monitors on its owned list, the
          thread will release/free up all the free monitors on its free list
          before exiting.

    Deflation of heavy weight monitors:
    ==================================
    Heavy weight monitors are deflated in the scavenging process.  Since a
    scavenging process is invoked immediately after each monitor inflation
    process, unlocked inflated monitors don't stay around for long.

    Synchronization between various Monitor Methods:
    ===============================================
    The following methods must be protected from themselves and each other by
    sync'ing on the same lock.  The lock currently used for this purpose is
    CVMglobals.syncLock.  The methods are as follows:
        1. CVMobjectInflate()
        2. CVMobjectSetHashBitsIfNeeded()
        3. CVMfastUnlock()

    Assumptions:
    ===========
    1. It is assumed that we won't ever enter a monitor recursively up to an
       reentry count of CVM_MAX_REENTRY_COUNT.  This allows
       CVM_INVALID_REENTRY_COUNT to be above CVM_MAX_REENTRY_COUNT.
       Debug builds will check that count never reaches CVM_MAX_REENTRY_COUNT.

              inflation of the monitor.  The inflation code would have attached
              the inflated CVMObjMonitor to the CVMOwnedMonitor that was
              previously tracking the reentry count for this monitor.  In this

              it will be 2 (once from the original fast lock, and once from the
              CVMprofiledMonitorEnterUnsafe() above) if not more depending on
              how many fast lock reentries have taken place before we got here.

           2. While attempting to do a fast lock for the first time on this
              object, another thread was calling CVMobjectSetHashBitsIfNeeded()
              on the same object.  This caused the fast lock to fail and ended
              up here even though this thread didn't already have a lock on this
              object.  In this case, the CVMprofiledMonitorEnterUnsafe() above
              would be the first lock on the monitor, and a CVMOwnedMonitor
              record hasn't been attached to the CVMObjMonitor yet.  This is
              why we need to attach the CVMObjMonitor to a CVMOwnedMonitor if

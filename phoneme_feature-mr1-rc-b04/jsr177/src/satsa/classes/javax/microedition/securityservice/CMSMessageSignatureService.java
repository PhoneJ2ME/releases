/**
 * Provides signature services for cryptographic messages.
 * <p>
 * Cryptographic operations are frequently required to realize
 * authentication, authorization, integrity, and privacy services.
 * These services may be provided at various layers (for example, 
 * communication layer, application layer, and so on). These services
 * form critical security components of larger systems
 * and services such as e-commerce, e-government, or corporate
 * applications. The layer at which these services are used are
 * governed by the security requirements of the system and the policies
 * used to formulate those requirements.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The services of authentication and authorization are often delivered
 * through the use of digital signatures. For a
 * digital signature to be useful, it must be possible to determine
 * what was signed, which algorithms were used, and who generated the
 * signature. Additional information may be included. The combination of
 * this information into a single construct is referred to as a formatted
 * digital signature.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A formatted digital signature is well suited to deliver the services
 * of authentication, authorization, and integrity of information at the
 * application layer within numerous systems. The generation of a formatted
 * digital signature involves the use of multiple cryptographic
 * operations including random number generation, hash generation, and the
 * application of a suitable signature algorithm. The cryptographic
 * operations are often performed on a security element that is trusted for
 * secure storage of cryptographic keys and secure computation of cryptographic
 * operations. The result of these cryptographic operations is combined with
 * information such as the user's identity and the data on which the
 * cryptographic operations are performed. This is then combined and presented
 * in a specific format that is expressed in ASN.1 or XML. The result is
 * referred to as a formatted digital signature. Examples of formatted digital
 * signatures include PKCS#7, CMS, and XML Digital Signature. This 
 * class supports
 * signature messages that conform to the Cryptographic Message Syntax
 * (CMS) format as specified in
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2630.txt">RFC 2630</a>
 * with enhanced security services for 
 * <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2634.txt">RFC 2634</a>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The complexity of generating a formatted digital signature is reduced
 * through the use of a high-level interface. The implementation 
 * is responsible for identifying and managing the appropriate security
 * elements, requesting the required cryptographic operations from the system
 * and security element, as well as performing the appropriate formatting of the
 * results. The advantages of this interface is twofold. First, the
 * complexity of
 * generating a formatted digital signature is removed from the application
 * developer. Second, the size of the implementation can be
 * drastically reduced, removing
 * the need for separate packages to access and manage security elements,
 * perform specific cryptographic operations, and formatting the results
 * appropriately.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class provides a compact and high-level cryptographic
 * interface that utilizes security elements available on a J2ME device.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * In this version of the interface, signature generation is defined for
 * authentication and authorization purposes. The <code>sign</code>
 * and <code>authenticate</code> methods return CMS-formatted
 * signatures. The signed message can be constructed with content
 * included (opaque signature) or without the content (detached 
 * signature).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * For the purpose of this interface, a security element is a device
 * or part of a
 * device that is trusted to provide secure storage of user credentials
 * and certificates as well as cryptographic keys. In addition, such a
 * device is trusted to perform secure computation involving
 * the cryptographic keys that are securely stored on the device.
 * If a requested security element can not be found, a
 * <code>UserCredentialManagerException</code> is thrown and
 * the <code>getReason</code> method MUST return
 * <code>UserCredentialManagerException.SE_NOT_FOUND</code>.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A device may have multiple security elements. The security elements may be
 * removable. Public information such as the user credential and a reference to
 * the corresponding security element may be cached on the J2ME device.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Authorization of the use of a key in a security element will be governed by
 * the policy of the security element (for example, no authorization
 * required, PIN
 * entry required, biometric required, and so on).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Cryptographic keys may be marked for different purposes, such as
 * non-repudiation
 * or authentication. The implementation will honor the key
 * usage defined
 * by a security element.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This class honors the key usage policy defined by the security
 * element by splitting
 * the generation of formatted digital signatures between two methods,
 * namely the
 * <code>sign</code> and <code>authenticate</code> methods. The sign method is
 * associated with keys marked for digital signature and non-repudiation. The
 * authenticate method is associated with keys marked for digital
 * signature only,
 * or digital signature and a key usage apart from non-repudiation (such as
 * authentication).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * These two methods, apart from being associated with a specific key
 * usage, also have
 * distinct behavior regarding user interaction. The
 * <code>sign</code> method will always display the text that is
 * about to be signed. The <code>authenticate</code> method
 * is overloaded and does not display the data that is about to be
 * signed, if that data is passed as a <code>byte</code> array. If the
 * data that is about to be signed is passed as a <code>String</code>,
 * it is always displayed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The <code>sign</code> method should be used for higher-value transactions and
 * authorizations while the <code>authenticate</code> method should be used
 * whenever a digital signature is required to authenticate a user. 
 * </p>
 *

     * Generates a signature that may be used for

     * this method may be tied to key pairs
     * marked for digital signature and authentication operations. It is
     * up to the implementation to search the available security
     * elements for relevant keys. Selection of the appropriate key is
     * facilitated by the <code>caNames</code> parameter. 
     * If the appropriate key is not found in any of the security elements
     * present in the device, the implementation may guide the user to
     * insert an alternative security element using the
     * <code>securityElementPrompt</code> parameter.
     *
     * <p>
     * The implementation MUST display the user friendly name of the
     * certificate or the certificate URI to the user. If more than
     * one certificate is found, the user MUST be presented with a
     * list of certificate friendly names. It is up to the user to
     * select the appropriate certificate based on the certificate
     * friendly name.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * The signature format is controlled through the
     * <code>options</code> parameter. If the
     * <code>options</code> parameter is non-zero and is
     * not a valid combination of
     * <code>CMSMessageSignatureService.SIG_INCLUDE_CERTIFICATE</code>
     * and
     * <code>CMSMessageSignatureService.SIG_INCLUDE_CONTENT</code>,
     * an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> exception
     * MUST be thrown.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Before requesting confirmation of the signature through a
     * PIN or some other means, the implementation of this method
     * MUST display the <code>stringToAuthenticate</code> to the user.
     * </p>
     *
     * <p>
     * Authorization to use a private key to generate a
     * signature is subject to the policy of the underlying
     * security element.
     * If signature authorization is required through the entry of a
     * PIN, the implementation of this method is responsible for
     * collecting the PIN from the user and presenting the PIN to
     * the security element. Incorrect PIN entry is handled
     * by the implementation. The number of retries following an 
     * incorrect PIN entry is governed by the security element
     * policy. If the PIN is blocked due to
     * an excessive number of incorrect PIN entries, the
     * implementation MUST throw a
     * <code>SecurityException</code> exception.
     * </p>

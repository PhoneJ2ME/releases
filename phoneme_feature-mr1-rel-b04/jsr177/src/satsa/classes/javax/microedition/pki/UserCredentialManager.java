/**
 * This class provides functionality for user credential management
 * which includes 
 * creating certificate signing requests, adding user credentials,
 * and removing credentials that may be used to generate digital
 * signatures as specified in the 
 * <code>CMSMessageSignatureService</code> class.
 * The initial version of credential management supports
 * X.509 version 3 Certificates and URIs that resolve to X.509
 * Certificates.
 * <p>
 * In a public key cryptographic system, a user has two distinct keys.
 * One key is kept private while the other is made public. There are
 * a number of public key cryptographic systems, some of which may
 * be used for the creation of digital signatures (for example, DSA), while
 * others can be used for encryption (for example, Rabin). Some systems may
 * be used for both encryption and digital signatures (for example, RSA).
 * Generally the private key, which is only known to the user,
 * is used to generate a signature or to decrypt a message. The
 * public key, as can be deduced from the name, is public knowledge
 * and is used to verify the user's signature or to encrypt
 * information intended for the user.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * When selecting a public key to encrypt a message or verify a
 * digital signature, it is important to be able to link the public
 * key either to the user for which the encrypted message is intended or to
 * the user that generated the signature. Public key infrastructure
 * (PKI) provides a mechanism for binding an identity to a public
 * key. The binding is expressed in a data structure known as a
 * certificate. The X.509 certificate format is one of the most
 * widely adopted certificate formats. X.509 certificates generally
 * contain at least the following information:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * An X.500 name that can potentially be linked to the identity
 * of the user.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The public key associated with the X.500 name.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * A validity period for the certificate (Not Before and Not After).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Information on the certificate issuer (an X.500 name for the
 * issuer and a serial number). This uniquely identifies a
 * certificate in a PKI.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The certificate may contain additional information. The certificate
 * itself is signed by the certificate issuer. The certificate issuer
 * is usually referred to as a Certificate Authority (CA).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The process that a CA follows before issuing a certificate is
 * governed by the certification practice statement (CPS) of the
 * CA. This usually involves both technical and non-technical
 * steps that need to be completed before a certificate is issued.
 * Technical steps include obtaining the public key that must be
 * certified, verifying that the user is in possession of the
 * corresponding private key, and returning the certificate or a
 * reference to the certificate once it is issued. Non-technical
 * steps include the processes followed to establish the
 * certificate requesters identity.
 * Upon completion of the technical and non-technical steps of the
 * registration process, the user is said to be enrolled into the PKI.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The purpose of this class is to provide the technical building
 * blocks required to enroll a user in a PKI. This will allow a
 * user to obtain a certificate that can be used in conjunction
 * with the <code>sign</code> and <code>authenticate</code> methods
 * in the <code>
 * javax.microedition.securityservice.CMSMessageSignatureService
 * </code> class.
 * This can also be used for
 * renewing and deleting certificates once they have expired. 
 * With this package it is possible to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Obtain a certificate signing request that can be sent to a PKI.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Add a certificate or certificate URI to a certificate store.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Remove a certificate or certificate URI from a certificate store.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Example</h2>
 *

 *    String nameInfo = new String("CN=User Name");
 *    byte[] enrollmentRequest = null;
 *    int keyLength = 1024;

 *    // User friendly names and prompts.
 *    String securityElementID = new String("Bank XYZ");

 *    // Certificate chain and URI from registration response.
 *    byte[] pkiPath; 
 *    String uri;

 *        // from the registration response.
 *         ...
 * 
 *        // Store the certificate on the security element.

 * <p>
 * <h2>Note regarding UI implementations</h2>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * User prompts and notifications should be implemented in such a way that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * the UI is distinguishable from a UI generated by external sources 
 * (for example J2ME applications).
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * external sources are not able to modify the data presented to the user.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * external sources are not able to retrieve the PIN data.
 * </li>
 * </ul>

     * Removal of the credential from the certificate store
     * must be confirmed by the user. The implementation must display
     * the user friendly
     * name of the certificate or the certificate URL. The user should
     * have the option
     * to view the detailed information of the credential, such as the
     * certificate issuer, certificate subject, and certificate
     * validity period.
     * This method returns <code>false</code> if the user cancels the
     * request to remove the credential.

     * subject to the policy
     * of the underlying security element or the platform. If user
     * authorization is required
     * through the entry of PIN, the implementation of this method 
     * is responsible for collecting the PIN from the user. Incorrect
     * PIN entry is handled
     * by the implementation. The number of retries following
     * incorrect PIN entry is
     * governed by the policy of the security element or the
     * platform. If the PIN is blocked due to an
     * excessive number of incorrect PIN entries, the implementation
     * must throw a
     * <code>SecurityException</code> exception.

     * @param certDisplayName the user friendly
     * name associated with the certificate.

     * that contains the certificate issuer and serial number as
     * defined in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3369.txt">
     * RFC 3369</a>.
     * If <code>issuerAndSerialNumber</code> is <code>null</code> or
     * not properly formatted according to RFC3369
     * an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code> is thrown.
     * If the requested certificate is not found, a
     * <code>UserCredentialManagerException</code> is thrown and
     * the <code>getReason</code> method MUST return
     * <code>CREDENTIAL_NOT_FOUND</code>.
     *
     * @param securityElementID identifies the security element on
     * which the key resides.  If this parameter is
     * <code>null</code> the implementation MUST choose the first
     * available security element that meets the specified requirements.
     * If no appropriate security element is found, the
     * <code>securityElementPrompt</code> parameter MUST be used
     * to guide the user on selecting the correct security element.
     * If no security element can be selected, a
     * <code>UserCredentialManagerException</code> is thrown and
     * the <code>getReason</code> method MUST return
     * <code>SE_NOT_FOUND</code>.

     * removable and not detected. 
     * If this parameter is set to <code>null</code>, no information

     * Invokes a remote method.
     * <p>A remote method invocation consists of three steps:</p>
     * <ol>
     * <li>Marshall the representation for the method and parameters.</p>
     * <p></p>
     * <li>Communicate the method invocation to the host and unmarshall the
     * return value or exception returned.</p>
     * <p></p>
     * <li>Return the result of the method invocation to the caller.</p>
     * <p></p>
     * </ol>
     *
     * The remote method invoked on the card can throw an exception to
     * signal that an unexpected condition has been detected.<p>
     *
     * If the exception thrown on the card is an exception defined in
     * the Java Card 2.2 API, then the same exception is thrown to the
     * stub method. The client can access the reason code associated
     * with Java Card-specific exceptions using the standard
     * <code>getReason()</code> method.<p>
     *
     * If the exception thrown on the card is a subclass of an exception
     * defined in the Java Card 2.2 API, then the closest exception defined
     * in the API (along with the reason code, if applicable) is
     * thrown to the stub method. The detail message string of the
     * exception object may indicate that exception subclass was thrown
     * on the card.<p>
     *
     * Apart from the exceptions thrown by the remote method itself,
     * errors during communication, marshalling, protocol handling,
     * unmarshalling, stub object instantiation, and so on, related
     * to the JCRMI method invocation, results in a
     * <code>RemoteException</code> being thrown to the stub method.
     *
     * @param method simple (not fully qualified) name of the method
     *        followed by the method descriptor. Representation of a
     *        method descriptor is the same as that described in The
     *        Java Virtual Machine Specification (&#167 4.3.3)
     * @param params the parameter list
     * @return result of remote method invocation

     *            the remote method invocation

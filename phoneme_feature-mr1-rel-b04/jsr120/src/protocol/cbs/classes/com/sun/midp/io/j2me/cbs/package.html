    <p>This is the optimized implementation for WMA 2.0, which provides
      classes that allow Java applications to access CBS functionality 
      on a mobile device.</p>
    <H2>CBS Implementation</H2>

    <P>
      The CBS has its own <tt>Protocol</tt> implementation that
      calls the native platform's CBS functionality. 

      <UL>
	<LI> The CBS URL connection string does not support 
	a designated host.</LI>
	<LI> The CBS <code>Connector.open()</code> will throw
	  an <code>IOException</code> if an attempt is made
	  to open for <code>WRITE</CODE>, since it is an 
	  inbound-only protocol.
	</LI>

	<LI> Attempts to call <code>send</code> will throw
	  an <code>IOException</code>.</LI>
      </UL>   
    </P>
    <h2>Sending Messages to a CBS Port</h2>

<p>CBS support is only available for inbound messages.
The rules for fragmenting large messages and the basic payload types for 
GSM 7-bit text, UCS-2 text, and binary messages are the
same for CBS and SMS messages.</p>

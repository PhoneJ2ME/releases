# Classes that should be initialized at build-time instead of run-time

#InitAtBuild =

# Do not rename the fields of the following classes because
# they are accessed via KNI_GetFieldID
#DontRenameNonPublicFields

# Do not rename the following classes because they are instantiated
# via Class.forName() or KNI_FindClass
#
#DontRenameClass = 

# These packages are hidden
# Non-romized code is prevented from accessing even public methods/fields
# of classes in these packages
#
#HiddenPackage = 


# These packages are restricted
# Non-romized code cannot load new classes into them
#
#RestrictedPackage =


# Quick native functions are smaller in ROM footprint and are faster to invoke.
# Do not use quick native for Java native function calls that have
# KNIxxxNewxxx, SNIxxxNewxxx, and SNI_ statements.
